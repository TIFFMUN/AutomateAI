  * SHOW_COMPANY_POLICIES_BUTTON (for policy review)  
  * SHOW_CULTURE_QUIZ_BUTTON (for culture quiz)
  * SHOW_EMPLOYEE_PERKS_BUTTON (for employee perks)

- These triggers will be converted to clickable buttons in the UI
- NEVER use regular text for buttons - always use the triggers
- Account setup (Node 3) does NOT use buttons - it's a direct conversation
