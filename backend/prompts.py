3. If a field is already filled (has a value or is true), acknowledge it as complete
4. Only ask for fields that are actually missing
5. If employmentContract, nda, and taxWithholding are all true, consider legal forms complete

EXAMPLE:
- If form has: {"employmentContract": true, "nda": true, "taxWithholding": true, "relationship": ""}
